We often make plots in data science.

Here's the tidyverse.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here's a dataframe.

```{r}
plot_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(100, mean =1, sd =2),
    y = 1+2*x + rnorm(100)
  )
```

To go back to the [homepage](index.html)
Here's a plot

```{r}
plot_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y))+
  geom_point()
```
